# Ingest IoT Data into Azure Synapse

> **Objective**: Create an Azure Stream Analytics Job that will send IoT Data into Azure Synapse Tables created at the step before.


## Create an Azure Stream Analytics Job

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

1. Select **Create a resource** in the upper left-hand corner of the Azure portal.  

1. Select **Analytics** > **Stream Analytics job** from the results list.  

1. Fill out the Stream Analytics job page with the following information:

   |**Setting**  |**Suggested value**  |**Description**  |
   |---------|---------|---------|
   |Job name   |  MyASAJob   |   Enter a name to identify your Stream Analytics job. Stream Analytics job name can contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only and it must be between 3 and 63 characters long. |
   |Subscription  | \<Your subscription\> |  Select the Azure subscription that you want to use for this job. |
   |Resource group   |   asaquickstart-resourcegroup  |   Select the same resource group as your IoT Hub. |
   |Location  |  \<Select the region that is closest to your users\> | Select geographic location where you can host your Stream Analytics job. Use the location that's closest to your users for better performance and to reduce the data transfer cost. |
   |Streaming units  | 1  |   Streaming units represent the computing resources that are required to execute a job. By default, this value is set to 1. To learn about scaling streaming units, refer to [understanding and adjusting streaming units](stream-analytics-streaming-unit-consumption.md) article.   |
   |Hosting environment  |  Cloud  |   Stream Analytics jobs can be deployed to cloud or edge. Cloud allows you to deploy to Azure Cloud, and Edge allows you to deploy to an IoT Edge device. |

4. Leave other options to default values and select **Save** to save the settings.  

## Write the Transformation Script

```sql
SELECT
    IoTHub.ConnectionDeviceId as DeviceId,
    ts  as TimeStamp,
    temp as Temperature
INTO
    [SynapseMeasurementTable]
FROM
    [IoTHubInput]
```
